# DNA Microarray

This short project was done for a bioinformatics company. The goal is to arrange 2500 DNA sequences on a 50x50 square lattice such that similar DNA sequences are next to each other. I devised a Monte Carlo metho to achieve this. The ipython notebook provides the details of algorithm and the results.
